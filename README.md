# CoLearning


# What is CoLearning?


CoLearning is a free online technology learning platform designed to reduce educational inequalities and offer new growth opportunities to all Colombians. CoLearning represents a new way of thinking about education, prioritizing the learning of emerging technologies and their application in solving real-world problems. Additionally, it fosters innovation and entrepreneurship by providing students with the necessary tools to turn their ideas into concrete projects.

# Why CoLearning?


In Colombia, many students in lower-middle-class schools face challenges such as drugs, violence, and lack of educational resources, which hinder their academic progress. Education in areas like programming, data analysis, and computing is practically nonexistent in the current educational system. This lack of computational learning means that there are no free and accessible alternatives for students to acquire these crucial skills. The lack of promotion of technological knowledge is evident: very few students know how websites are developed or that there is an engineering field dedicated to it.

# How can CoLearning help?
CoLearning is designed to address these challenges in several ways:

- Access to Quality Education: We provide free and accessible courses in programming, data analysis, and other technologies, eliminating economic and geographic barriers.

- Practical Application of Knowledge: Our courses are designed for students to apply their knowledge to real-world problems, fostering practical and relevant skills for the job market.

- Innovation and Entrepreneurship: CoLearning encourages innovation and entrepreneurship by providing resources and mentorship for students to develop their own ideas and projects.

- Safe and Enriching Environment: By creating an online learning community, we keep students away from dangerous environments and offer them a safe space to develop and learn.

- Knowledge and Awareness: Through our courses, students will discover the various opportunities technology offers, from website creation to software engineering, expanding their horizons and professional aspirations.

CoLearning not only offers an educational platform but also builds a bridge to a better future, where all Colombians can access the opportunities that technology provides and improve their quality of life.

# update 19/07

I worked more on the implementation of the login and signup page, usign jwt for the authentication token, ensuring more security for each account avoiding data leaks. Right now the design is just a template from the shadcn page but the functionality of signup and login is mostly done. I thought about email or mobile verification but my audience is not very used to it so i'll find other alternatives to avoid spams like captcha or something like that.
